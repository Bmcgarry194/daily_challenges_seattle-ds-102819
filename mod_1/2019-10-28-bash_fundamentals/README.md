# Bash Fundamentals

Hello! 

1. Run `sh lyrics.sh` from your project directory (i.e. `daily_challenges_seattle-ds-102819/mod_1/2019-10-28-bash_fundamentals`)
     + At this point, you should get the following error: 
     ```bash
     sh: lyrics.sh: No such file or directory
     ```
     + Your goal is the following:
         + Locate `lyrics.sh` within the project directory
         + Copy `lyrics.sh` from whatever it and paste it into the project directory
         + Re-run `sh lyrics.sh`
         + _Hint: run the command `tree` from your project directory and visually inspect the structure of the directory_
